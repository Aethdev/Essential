\+ more..


## Installation

Essential only has one installation method currently. Roblox Marketplace will come soon hopefully in Spring 2025.

### Rojo (intermediate knowledge)

Creating a new place: You can open this file to create a Roblox local place for editing Essential
```
rojo build -o "essential-workplace-git.rbxlx"
```

Using your existing place: You can open a team-create/live place on Roblox studio and connect to Rojo in the place. However, you must allow Rojo to serve your project files before live syncing on studio.

```
rojo serve
```

For Rojo installation and additional information, refer to https://rojo.space/docs/v7/help/


## Contribution

Want to contribute? Great! First, create a Rojo project, instructed under Installation section, and edit source code in a code editing software (i.g. Visual Studio Code).
